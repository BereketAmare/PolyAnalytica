# Multi-Method Analysis: Income Trends

This is an ongoing project analyzing the Census Income dataset to predict if a person's income exceeds $50K a year.

## Project Overview:
- **Foundational Algorithms**: Analysis using KNN, Decision Trees, and Regression.
- **Ensemble Techniques**: Using Random Forests and AdaBoost.
- **Advanced Methods**: Exploration with SVMs and kernel methods.
- **Model Assessment**: Metrics include accuracy, F1 score, and ROC curves.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Current phase integrating deep learning techniques.

## Setup and Installation:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.

## Data Source:
The analysis uses the Adult dataset, also known as the "Census Income" dataset, located in the `data` directory.

### Adult Dataset Details:
- **Objective**: Predict if income is above $50K/year using census data.
- **Type**: Multivariate
- **Tasks**: Classification
- **Features**: 14 in total, both categorical and integer types.
- **Instances**: 48,842
- **Note**: The dataset has missing values and was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

## Notebooks:
Analysis is spread across multiple notebooks:
